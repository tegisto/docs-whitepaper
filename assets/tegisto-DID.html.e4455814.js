There are critical benefits of decentralized identity for organizations, individual users, and developers. In organizations, issue and verify fraud-proof credentials and documents instantly and reduce the risk of data violations by keeping fewer user&#39;s information. The users can own and control their digital identity with more privacy. For developers, secure authentication sign-in for application users that bypasses passwords and privacy-preserving user verifications are used.</p><p>A decentralized identity system has a blockchain, Decentralized Identity Wallet, Decentralized Identifier, and Verifiable Credential components. Blockchain is a decentralized database shared among computers in the blockchain network that records information securely.Decentralized Identity Wallet is an app that lets users create decentralized identifiers and manage their Verifiable Credentials.Decentralized Identifier (DID) is a unique identifier on the blockchain created of a string of letters and numbers. They contain details of the public key and verification information.</p><p>Verifiable Credential (VC) is a digital, cryptographically secured version of the paper and digital credentials that people can put forward to organizations that need them for verification.
