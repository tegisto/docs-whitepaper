On June 29th the first step of the Seed sale was completed. The amount sold in the first round is 10% unlocked and the remaining unlocked daily over 6 months. 500.000.000 TGS tokens have been sold in the first round of seed sales and the remaining 130.000.000 is preserved for the second round. The sales in the second round will be done with cUSD.

Public sale will be held once the platform is live. Everyone will be able to take part in the public sale and these tokens will be unlocked. Public sale price will be disclosed in the future.

Liquidity is an essential part of the token economy as these tokens will be used to provide the TGS token liquidity in pools.

Team and advisor tokens will be used to cover for all expenses regarding salaries and expenditures of the project. As the team is devoted to the project for a long time, a 5 year lockup is planned. Marketing and development expenditures will be made from the relevant token allocation and therefore all project expenses are accounted for.

Strategic partnership tokens are important for the Tegisto ecosystem to grow and partner projects can buy from these tokens to create liquidity for their farms on Tegisto.

Tegisto DAO will be running the DAO Reserve and Treasury budget in the token economy. TGS token holders will have the privilege of proposing, voting and debating on topics such as covering the listing costs of a certain exchange, allocating extra marketing funds for specified marketing activities or hiring a person to run certain tasks in the ecosystem.

The platform plans to keep users incentivized for a long period of time and thus has a separate token allocation for staking and farming. This is a key benefit for the users and make up 1/3 of the whole token economy.
