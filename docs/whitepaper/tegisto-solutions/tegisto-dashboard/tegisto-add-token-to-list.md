### Tegisto Add Token to List

Any project can request a crypto-asset listing in the Tegisto platform. Project simply follows the instructions below to have the crypto-asset of choice submitted for listing in the Tegisto platform. If the listing is validated by The Tegisto DAO, the crypto-asset will then become part of the platform and will be listed on the Tegisto.

Adding token process is very easy. Project fills out all the information about the crypto-assets. The listing fee is determined by Tegisto DAO. These fees are added into the Tegisto DAO Treasury who verify the information of each listed token.

The Tegisto DAO will review crypto-asset listing request and accept it if the information shared are valid. Right after listing request, token will be able to view the listing request on the Tegisto DAO Proposal Page, and then on the final validation page.
