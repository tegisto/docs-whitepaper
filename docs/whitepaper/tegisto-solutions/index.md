## Tegisto Solutions
The internet is evolving, and centralized applications are turning into decentralized applications powered by blockchain technology. Decentralized finance (DeFi) enables millions of people worldwide to exchange assets, earn passive income, get loans, and much more without intermediaries. Today, many companies provide their services with Web2-based applications. The company sees the opportunity to transform the technological dispersion brought by blockchain technology into business models and wants to take its place in this world quickly. It needs the necessary Web3 conversion services to evaluate the values they produce within the concept of this new internet of money. Companies can increase their earnings by tokenizing products and services during this process.

Currently, there are hundreds of DeFi platforms in the crypto world. These platforms offer essential DeFi services such as token trading, passive income, and loaning. Projects on the platforms can be in any domain, and investors only trade with the price movements of the token. On the other hand, centralized exchanges reach large investor masses and again only offer token trading services. Incubation platforms provide opportunities for projects in the initial supply of tokens. DAO platforms deliver services to organizations on governance issues. Tegisto provides a holistic solution that determines the token usage scope for the products and services of companies, provides the necessary technological services, includes the DeFi services they will need, and the whole process is managed with DAO.

Tegisto provides a platform where companies can carry out the technological infrastructure processes that will enable this transformation and where companies can conduct their operations in crypto finance. Company tokens are designed as a structure that offers and manages new services to its customers with functions rather than a token traded on centralized exchanges. These tokens will also serve global expansion strategies that will allow companies to grow.

Tegisto primarily present Web3 solutions as a service that companies will need in Web2 applications in the transition to blockchain technology (connecting to wallets from existing websites, integration services with existing software, dashboards that can manage processes, etc.). These services will be designed to cover products and services depending on the function of the company token. Tegisto is a solution platform that covers the incubation processes of company tokens, marketing processes, and additional services they may need in the future in a sustainable structure.

Companies are organizations that operate as financial and legal establishments. Therefore, compliance with the regulations is essential in their transactions in the crypto world. Tegisto also offers the DID concept as a holistic solution, where they can carry out the KYC processes necessary for use in operations on DeFi. Tegisto helps companies by providing the DID they will need in their financial and legal regulations while tokenizing on DeFi.

All services on the platform will be carried out under the control of TGS token investors. This comes from decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) that share control with investors. Thus, investors can be allowed to say in the platform's management, and incentivize usage through tangible ownership and governance rewards.
