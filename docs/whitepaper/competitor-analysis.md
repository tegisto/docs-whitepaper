No competitors in terms of company tokenizations but DYDX is an important competitor in terms of one stop DEX with DID’s to be added in the future. Generally it is rare to see an established DEX that is proficient in both launchpad operations and classical DeFi features like farms, staking and etc. Tegisto will be providing all those features along with a chance to buy product or service offerings of real world companies on blockchain.
