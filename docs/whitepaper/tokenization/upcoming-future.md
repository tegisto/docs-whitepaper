## Upcoming future: Every Company Will Have Their Own Tokens

Tokenization is the conversion of ownership rights to an asset into a digital token on a blockchain. Each token has its own value. As blockchain is playing a bigger role in our lives each day, companies will adapt to use blockchain to provide fast and transparent solutions.

**Benefits of Tokenization:**

 - Tokenization eliminates a lot of red tape while allowing access to
   data such as ownership history for all resources. Asset histories and
   registers are public and available to owners at any time.
   
 - In a highly liquid global market, tokenization allows people to buy
   and sell assets 24/7, often with a single click, without
   intermediaries. Such systems have the advantage of transparency and
   reliability. Tampering and manipulation is prohibited and there is no
   place for it. Using tokens and blockchain technology can give you a
   competitive advantage.
   
 - There are no geographic restrictions on trading. It offers more
   features than traditional solutions, such as verification of change
   of ownership based on the monetary value of cryptocurrencies.
