## Decentralized Company Tokens Exchange

Projects operating in the blockchain space are traded on many decentralized exchanges, where they can offer their own crypto assets on different blockchain networks. Tegisto will act as a company token exchange where goods and services produced by companies operating in the real sector, as well as projects in the field of blockchain, are tokenized. Thus, a new concept in the financial field will open an alternative area of opportunity for investors who invest in real companies.

With different trading pairs on the decentralized company token exchange, investors will be able to trade company crypto assets. In addition, by offering approaches that can bring passive income to the investor, they will be able to use the financial resources they have obtained in the development of new products.
