## Liquidity Pools

Liquidity pools are where the liquidity needed in swaps and farms is created. When a user adds liquidity to liquidity pools, he/she can earn share in the fees accrued in swaps, which is 0.05%.

You add an equal-worth amount of tokens to create a pair and therefore receive LP tokens. The number of LP tokens you receive is equivalent to your share in the liquidity pool. You can add or remove LP tokens anytime you wish, it should be noted that the tokens in your LP will fluctuate parallel to the volatility of the two tokens’ price.
