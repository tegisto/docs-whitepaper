## Incubation

Tegisto incubation programme is a comprehensive kickstarter campaign of a project to receive the advantage below:

 - Seed funding
 - Launch on Tegisto
 - Devise and execute market making strategy
 - Receive marketing support

Incubation programme is separate from the launchpad and therefore requires a separate application involving but not limited to information such as:

 - Project Name
 - Project Logo
 - Project Description
 - Project Team
 - Whitepaper / Litepaper
 - Incorporation documents (if available)
 - Pitch Deck
 - Website
 - Social media channels
 - Contact information

After a thorough due diligence selected projects will go through a series of meetings with our admission board and finally will be voted by our DAO to get the approval of incubation. In order to get approval from the DAO the project needs to get at least xxx amount of votes.
