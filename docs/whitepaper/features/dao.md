## DAO

Tegisto is designed to be a true decentralized autonomous organization, DAO. Many aspects of the token economy will not be unlocked by time but rather by accomplishments. Targets will be made and tokens such as farming incentives etc will be unlocked by voting. The community will decide to provide farming incentives for a token and it will be once again up to the community to make decisions on Tegisto’s best interests. This will be a groundbreaking development in the blockchain industry and Tegisto will be the first and only DEX operating in such a way.

There will be a governance component of Tegisto where TGS holders can propose, vote and debate on actions to be taken. This is unique in bringing together the community strictly of holders under the same roof. DAO will also make decisions on funding listings and marketing activities from the DAO reserve or treasury.

Users in the DAO governance system can transfer their delegation to other users without having to send over tokens.
