## Multichain

Tegisto is initially being launched on the CELO network. Upon launch, the first network to be integrated will be Binance Smart Chain. Gradually more networks will be integrated and Tegisto will operate as a truly Multichain Platform. In order to operate as a truly multichain platform Tegisto will also launch its own multichain bridge. This bridge is targeted to open within 2022.
