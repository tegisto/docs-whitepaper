## Integrating DID into Tegisto

Tegisto is planning to be compliant by developing and integrating decentralized identifiers (DID) in a private manner. In this context, Trufeedback will first investigate how to make DeFi compliant and then aims to find the best potential approach to integrate with Tegisto. Hence, in this way, Tegisto could be one of the promising platforms which might bring more users including conventional businesses. Also, Tegisto users will successfully manage to be anonymous and their personal data will not be shared with any parties.
