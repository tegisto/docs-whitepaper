## Yield Farming

Having created liquidity pools (LP’s), you can invest the LP tokens in yield farming. Every farm has a different pair and thus different LP is required. These farms provide incentives in TGS tokens, or different tokens depending on the farm. Farms with dual or triple rewards may also be possible.

Farms provide rewards in 2 ways:

 - The rewards in the farm incentives
 - The rewards you earn from swap fees with your LP.

These two rewards add up to give you your farm APR (Annual Percentage Return). You will also see your return in APY, assuming you compound the rewards every 6 months.
