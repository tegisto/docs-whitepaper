## IDO Launchpad

Tegisto launchpad is one of the core features of Tegisto. Tokens can have their IDO, initial Dex offering, on Tegisto and have a chance to reach a high number of holders from the get-go. As Tegisto will be multichain, projects from different networks will be able to hold their launch on Tegisto. Thus, TGS holders on a variety of networks will be able to benefit from the launches on the platform and be able to be whitelisted for the IDO offerings.

As company tokenization, to be elaborated in the later pages, plays an important role in Tegisto Launchpad, users will be able to evaluate the tokenization of different company products and play a role in the Seed/Launch phase of the project.

The final vote to accept a project to the launchpad will be coming from our DAO and the community will handpick the projects that will launch on Tegisto. Once the minimum threshold for a project is passed, the team will get in touch regarding details about launching the token on Tegisto.
