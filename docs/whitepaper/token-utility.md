## Token Utility

 1. Creating liquidity pairs for new listings
 2. Staking to take part in launchpads
 3. Launchpad and incubation applications
 4. Voting and proposing changes on DAO

The pairs on Tegisto will be created with the TGS token and anyone trading will be routed from TGS token, thus creating volume and additional utility for the TGS token as well.

The total supply is fixed and will not increase over time. 0.10% of all trades are used towards TGS buyback and burns. Thus, **the amount of TGS will decrease with every swap transaction**.
