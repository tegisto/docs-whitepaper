NEITHER TEGISTO GAMETECHNOLOGIES OÜ (THE **COMPANY**), ANY OF THE PROJECT TEAM MEMBERS (THE **TEGISTO TEAM**) WHO HAVE WORKED ON TEGISTO (AS DEFINED HEREIN) OR PROJECT TO DEVELOP TEGISTO IN ANY WAY WHATSOEVER, ANY DISTRIBUTOR/VENDOR OF TGS TOKENS (THE **DISTRIBUTOR**), NOR ANY SERVICE PROVIDER SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY KIND OF DIRECT OR INDIRECT DAMAGE OR LOSS WHATSOEVER WHICH YOU MAY SUFFER IN CONNECTION WITH ACCESSING THE PAPER, DECK OR MATERIAL RELATING TO TGS (THE **TOKEN DOCUMENTATION**) AVAILABLE ON THE WEBSITE AT WWW.TEGISTO.IO (THE **WEBSITE**, INCLUDING ANY SUB-DOMAINS THEREON) OR ANY OTHER WEBSITES OR MATERIALS PUBLISHED BY THE COMPANY.

**Project purpose:** You agree that you are acquiring TGS to participate in Tegisto and to obtain services on the ecosystem thereon. The Company, the Distributor and their respective affiliates would develop and contribute to the underlying source code for Tegisto. The Company is acting solely as an arms’ length third party in relation to the TGS distribution, and not in the capacity as a financial advisor or fiduciary of any person with regard to the distribution of TGS.

**Nature of the Token Documentation:** The Token Documentation is a conceptual paper that articulates some of the main design principles and ideas for the creation of a digital token to be known as TGS. The Token Documentation and the Website are intended for general informational purposes only and do not constitute a prospectus, an offer document, an offer of securities, a solicitation for investment, any offer to sell any product, item, or asset (whether digital or otherwise), or any offer to engage in business with any external individual or entity provided in said documentation. The information herein may not be exhaustive and does not imply any element of,  or solicit in any way, a contractual relationship.

Further, you acknowledge that circumstances may change and that the Token Documentation or the Website may become outdated as a result; and neither the Company nor the Distributor is under any obligation to update or correct this document in connection therewith.

**Token Documentation:** Nothing in the Token Documentation or the Website constitutes any offer by the Company, the Distributor, or the Tegisto team to sell any TGS (as defined herein) nor shall it or any part of it nor the fact of its presentation form the basis of, or be relied upon in connection with, any contract or investment decision. Nothing contained in the Token Documentation or the Website is or may be relied upon as a promise, representation or undertaking as to the future performance of Tegisto. The agreement between the Distributor (or any third party) and you, in relation to any distribution or transfer of TGS, is to be governed only by the separate terms and conditions of such agreement.

The information set out in the Token Documentation and the Website is for community discussion only and is not legally binding. No person is bound to enter into any contract or binding legal commitment in relation to the acquisition of TGS, and no digital asset or other form of payment is to be accepted on the basis of the Token Documentation or the Website. The agreement for distribution of TGS and/or continued holding of TGS shall be governed by a separate set of Terms and Conditions or Token Distribution Agreement (as the case may be) setting out the terms of such distribution and/or continued holding of TGS (the Terms and Conditions), which shall be separately provided to you or made available on the Website. The Terms and Conditions must be read together with the Token Documentation. In the event of any inconsistencies between the Terms and Conditions and the Token Documentation or the Website, the Terms and Conditions shall prevail.

**d-** none of the Company, the Distributor, their respective affiliates, and/or the Tegisto team members shall be responsible for or liable for the value of TGS, the transferability and/or liquidity of TGS and/or the availability of any market for TGS through third parties or otherwise; and

**e-** you acknowledge, understand and agree that you are not eligible to participate in the distribution of TGS if you are a citizen, national, resident (tax or otherwise), domiciliary and/or green card holder of a geographic area or country (i) where it is likely that the distribution of TGS would be construed as the sale of a security (howsoever named), financial service or investment product and/or (ii) where participation in token distributions is prohibited by applicable law, decree, regulation, treaty, or administrative act (including without limitation the United States of America, Canada, and the People's Republic of China); and to this effect you agree to provide all such identity verification document when requested in order for the relevant checks to be carried out.

The Company, the Distributor and the Tegisto team do not and do not purport to make, and hereby disclaims, all representations, warranties or undertaking to any entity or person (including without limitation warranties as to the accuracy, completeness, timeliness, or reliability of the contents of the Token Documentation or the Website, or any other materials published by the Company or the Distributor). To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Company, the Distributor, their respective affiliates and service providers shall not be liable for any indirect, special, incidental, consequential or other losses of any kind, in tort, contract or otherwise (including, without limitation, any liability arising from default or negligence on the part of any of them, or any loss of revenue, income or profits, and loss of use or data) arising from the use of the Token Documentation or the Website, or any other materials published, or its contents (including without limitation any errors or omissions) or otherwise arising in connection with the same. Prospective acquirors of TGS should carefully consider and evaluate all risks and uncertainties (including financial and legal risks and uncertainties) associated with the distribution of TGS, the Company, the Distributor and the Tegisto team.

**TGS Token:** TGS are designed to be utilised, and that is the goal of the TGS distribution. In particular, it is highlighted that TGS:

**a-** does not have any tangible or physical manifestation, and does not have any intrinsic value (nor does any person make any representation or give any commitment as to its value);

**b-** is non-refundable and cannot be exchanged for cash (or its equivalent value in any other digital asset) or any payment obligation by the Company, the Distributor or any of their respective affiliates;

**c-** does not represent or confer on the token holder any right of any form with respect to the Company, the Distributor (or any of their respective affiliates), or its revenues or assets, including without limitation any right to receive future dividends, revenue, shares, ownership right or stake, share or security, any voting, distribution, redemption, liquidation, proprietary (including all forms of intellectual property or licence rights), right to receive accounts, financial statements or other financial data, the right to requisition or participate in shareholder meetings, the right to nominate a director, or other financial or legal rights or equivalent rights, or intellectual property rights or any other form of participation in or relating to Tegisto, the Company, the Distributor and/or their service providers;

**d-** is not intended to represent any rights under a contract for differences or under any other contract the purpose or pretended purpose of which is to secure a profit or avoid a loss;

**e-** is not intended to be a representation of money (including electronic money), security, commodity, bond, debt instrument, unit in a collective investment scheme or any other kind of financial instrument or investment;

**f-** is not a loan to the Company, the Distributor or any of their respective affiliates, is not intended to represent a debt owed by the Company, the Distributor or any of their respective affiliates, and there is no expectation of profit; and

**g-** does not provide the token holder with any ownership or other interest in the Company, the Distributor or any of their respective affiliates.

Notwithstanding the TGS distribution, users have no economic or legal right over or beneficial interest in the assets of the Company, the Distributor, or any of their affiliates after the token distribution.

To the extent a secondary market or exchange for trading TGS does develop, it would be run and operated wholly independently of the Company, the Distributor, the distribution of TGS and Tegisto. Neither the Company nor the Distributor will create such secondary markets nor will either entity act as an exchange for Tegisto.

Please do not rely on this information in deciding whether to participate in the token distribution because ultimately, the development, release, and timing of any products, features or functionality remains at the sole discretion of the Company, the Distributor or their respective affiliates, and is subject to change. Further, the Token Documentation or the Website may be amended or replaced from time to time.
